Building a new website for Etikett Radio using MERN tech stack and socket.io // final project for DCI

## User Stories

### Visitor

A visitor is entering the website to listen to the ongoing stream. Because his/her internet is not too good, the visitor decides to not watch the stream but to only listen to the audio feed instead. The host is a friend so the visitor enters a temporary username to join the chat and say hi. Other users in the chat room have a discussion about the ongoing show in which the visitor is entering.

### Host/Operator

A new host is about to start his first show on etikett radio when he reviews his show description and the artwork with his/her logo, which he/she uploaded a few hours prior, one last time. The host is looking at the ongoing chat to get a feeling for the vibes of the current listeners while he/she hears his/her name when the current host announces the next show for the upcoming 2 hours. In a private message, the current host tells the new host that he had to ban somebody from the chat because of his aggressive behavior.

### Admin

It's about the end of the month and the admin has to update the database with the schedule of the upcoming month. He/she also added a new host account and while reviewing the artist description, the admin realizes a typo which is quickly fixed. While he was thinking about the blog post he/she still has to write, the admin also thinks about to ask a trustworthy host to help him with all the data they have to implement or to update and after a quick call, the admin gives this host the right to edit the schedule.
